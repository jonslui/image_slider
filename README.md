## Image Carousel

An Image Carousel module that takes links to images and a parent container to create a slider that changes images every 5 seconds, allows for moving forwards and backward, and selection by clicking on the corresponding dot.

## Usage
1. Import the createImageSlider() function and enter its 3 parameters: an array of images, a parent container to append the slider too, and a boolean to determine whether the slider auto-scrolls or not.
2. Enjoy!
